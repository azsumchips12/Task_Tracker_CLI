🧭 CLI Task Tracker

A small command-line todo tracker I built using Python, Typer, Rich, and SQLite.
I made and tested it in PyCharm


💡 What i used:


Typer → for creating the CLI commands

Rich → for colorful and clean terminal tables

SQLite → for storing tasks locally

Datetime → to track when tasks were added or completed


🧠 What I learned / understood


How to structure a small CLI app in Python

How to use Typer commands and options

How to connect and manage data with SQLite

How to display styled output with Rich

How to handle task positions and updates in a database


⚙️ How to Run it (in PyCharm)

Open the project in PyCharm

Make sure you have Python set up as the interpreter

Run the file directly or use the terminal:

python todocli.py add "Learn Typer" "Study"
python todocli.py show
